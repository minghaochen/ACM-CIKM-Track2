## 赛题二 : 自动超参数优化

The choices of hyperparameters have critical effects on models or strategies in recommendation systems. But the hyperparameters are mostly chosen based on experience, which brings high maintenance costs and sub-optimal results. Thus, this track aims at automated hyperparameters optimization based on anonymized realistic industrial tasks and datasets. Given the space of all possible hyperparameters' values, a reward could be achieved with a set of hyperparameters in each iteration. The participants are asked to maximize the reward within a given limit of iterations with a hyperparameters optimization algorithm. The final rank of the participants will be the rank of their maximum reward.
